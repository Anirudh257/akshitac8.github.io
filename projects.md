#### Audio-Vision
* Introduced anopen source librarywith a few research papers code, well- documentation and genuine results.
* Audio: This Section includes paper dealing with specific task like audio classification and tagging. The frameworksinclude attention, recurrent encoder-decoder, CNN + LSTM, ensemble, and multi-feature.
* Vision: This Section includes paper tackling with Visual Question Answering problem including frameworks likedeeper LSTM, stacked attention.[Github](https://github.com/channelCS/Audio-Vision)

#### Handwriting Generation
* Pytorch Implementation of Conditional + Unconditional Handwriting generation with the help of LSTM + AttentionMechanismon sequence dataset.[Github](https://github.com/akshitac8/Handwriting_Generation)

#### Mixed Script Queries & Response
* Proposed a bi-gram and tri-gram recurrent neural network withMAP & MRR metrics to identify incorrectly written queries in mixed script (English, Hindi, Gujarati) samples. 
* An increase of +2% in Mean Average Precision Scorewas recorded.[Technical Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UUWQTp6aIeUZyjhwfcGo2YoGJCVIjunr/view?usp=sharing)

#### Kerasaud
* Audio library build on top of Keras framework which includes build in architectures including preprocessing data,feature extraction, and framing the feature maps. [Github](https://github.com/channelCS/keras_aud)

#### Career Services
* Student-placement coordinators interaction platform. A website portalfor users to control, see and get updates of all placement activities from anywhere.[Webpage](http://dit.channelcs.com/help_user.html)
