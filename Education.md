### Semester Exchange Student
* Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee
* Advisor: _Dr R Balasubramanian_
* Bachelor Thesis:&nbsp; Attention based Visual QA, Implemented a model for Visual Question Answering(VQA) which used stacked attention mechanism to produce a feature importance weighting vector on the VGG16 last Convolution layer features of the image using the question embedding as a query vector.
* Final model performed better than model which exercised single pass attention mechanism. We hypothesized that multiple steps of reasoning is required to answer questions about fine grained information in image.
* Implemented Faster-RCNN, YOLOv2 and applied it on INRIA person dataset.
